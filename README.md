# TO-DO-LIST
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a To-Do List?
A To-Do List is a simple organizational tool that helps you keep track of tasks you want to accomplish. It can be as simple as pen and paper or as complex as a fully-featured app.
Why Customization Matters in a To-Do List
Customization lets users adapt the list to their workflow and preferences, improving productivity and satisfaction. A customizable To-Do List can:
Reflect your unique task management style
Prioritize tasks visually and logically
Integrate with your daily routine and tools
Provide motivation through personalization
